# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-statsmodels
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.
#
# The SAME suite is exercised over three VGI transports, selected by $TRANSPORT.
# The vgi extension picks the transport from the LOCATION string the .test files
# ATTACH (`${VGI_STATSMODELS_WORKER}`):
#
#   subprocess : a bare stdio command (`.venv/bin/vgi-statsmodels`) — the
#                extension spawns the worker per query and talks Arrow IPC over
#                stdin/stdout. Default; current behavior.
#   http       : the worker is started out-of-band in `--http` mode on an auto
#                port; LOCATION becomes `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
#   unix       : the worker is started out-of-band on an AF_UNIX socket;
#                LOCATION becomes `unix://<sock>`.
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST       path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   VGI_STATSMODELS_WORKER the stdio command that runs the worker (the installed
#                          `vgi-statsmodels` console script in the project venv).
#                          Used directly as the LOCATION for subprocess, and as
#                          the process this script boots for http/unix.
# Optional:
#   TRANSPORT              subprocess | http | unix (default: subprocess)
#   STAGE                  scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
